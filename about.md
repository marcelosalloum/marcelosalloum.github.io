Experienced iOS Developer, holds great knowledge of the software outsourcing industry, having worked with dozens of projects as a lead iOS Developer, project manager and consultant throughout 7 years of a first-rate professional experience.

### Some of my history

I started working with IT as a web developer intern when I was graduating in Engineering at UFSC, a Federal University from Brazil.

After a few personal projects during my graduation, I created a startup called Dyfocus with a few colleagues of mine. It was a picture based social network app, running in iOS. Our product stood for 1.5 years in the market and we learned a lot about product management, project management and IT technologies in general. As an output from that startup, we created a software development house called Cheesecake Labs, where I worked for 5 years (2013-2018).

Cheesecake Labs is the company where I've acquired most of my professional experience. I worked mainly as an iOS developer for 5+ years, also getting involved with other technologies and fields, such as Python+Django and project management. During the time I was at Cheesecake, I developed more than ten products in iOS, also helping my colleagues as the most experienced iOS developer. From that amount of experience, I've faced a lot of challenges and I have learnt how to deliver great products in a small amount of time, making sure my code is stable and intuitive, so the other developers could follow-up from what I had started.

After leading the iOS team for so much time at Cheesecake Labs, the company size increased so much it was getting too stressful for me. That's why I've left the company and decided to continue my career as a remote iOS Developer.

Since January 2019 Iâ€™ve been working as a solo iOS Developer for startups and enterprises.
